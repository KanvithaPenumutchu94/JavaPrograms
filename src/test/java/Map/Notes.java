	//Map is Interface
	//A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. 
	//Each key and value pair is known as an entry.
	//A Map contains unique keys.
	//A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
	//A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values.
	//HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values,
	//but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
	//HashMap:HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
	//LinkedHashMap:LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
	//TreeMap:TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order.
